<h1>My Inspiration Is My Family!!</h1>

My Father
    </h2>
<hr>
<p>My father gets most of the credit because he supported me all the way with cycling since I was small. He helped me gain my balance and my confidence. Thanks to him, I am a great cyclist!!(If I do say so myself!!)</p>

My Mother
    </h3>
<hr>
<p>My mother is the one who actually started this cycling business! One day, she surprised me with a bike. I have to admit, I was really surprised!! She helped me practice with the four-wheeled bike and she raised my confidence. So I rode that bike for a lot of days and I was getting better at it. Then, when I tried the two-wheeled bike, I was surprised that it wasn't as hard as I expected it to be! So, with the balance and confidence that I gained from riding a four-wheeled bike, I learned how to ride a two-wheeled bike in no time! </p>

My Sister
    </h4>
<hr>
<p>My sister is the bravest person that I know! I just watched in awe when she learned how to ride a bike. She didn't really have as much practice that I had with the four-wheeled bike. Still she didn't take that much time to learn how to ride a two-wheeled bike. Of course, my father helped gain her balance and confidence just like he did for me. That way she was riding a two-wheeled bike beside me in no time!! She inspires me to be more confidend and brave! </p> 
<h5>I love my family,a.k.a.: My Inspirations!! They inspired me to believe in myself, to try to make others happy, and to be brave. ‚ù§</h5>
